# zero2asic_installer

Just run:

```
sudo ./z2a_installer.sh
```

and it must install all components except KLayout as it is indicated to cause issues if not installed properly for your Ubuntu version.

BE CAREFUL: run the script only once, if it fails, you'll likely have to modify the .bashrc file as some exports are added to it.

The script was tested in Ububtu 20 and Linux Mint Cinnamon
